# HTML CSS: Code Refactor
A homework demo reflecting correct usage of semantic tags and flow.

## Project Summary
A homework assignment demonstrating the correct usage of semantic tags and the importance of alt attributes. Also, providing practice on how to properly follow and meet the criteria of a code refactor project.

### Result
Upon completing the code refactor, I have ensured all links work properly, the document structure now has context due to the use of semantic tags, that the document has a legitimate title and all image elements have suitable alt attributes.
